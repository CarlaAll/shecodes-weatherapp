# shecodes-weatherapp
 
This side is my first coding project including API and external hosting. 

This weather forecast is the outcome of my final assignment from www.shecodes.io Workshop+. 
I used the API of openweatherdata.org: Current Weather Data and 5 day5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast
The design is inspirated by shecodes, google default weather forecast and different weather-app designs from Dribbble (source Pinterest).

Thank you Matt for the great lessons.
